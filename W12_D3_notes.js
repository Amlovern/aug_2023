SECURITY

CORS - Cross-Origin Resource Sharing
    Allows other apps to send requests to our backend
    Enforced by the browser
        !! Not all browsers enforce CORS policies
    CORS policies are just middleware

XSS attacks - Cross Site Scripting
    Being able to inject code into someone else's application/website

CSRF attacks - Cross Site Resource Forgery
    When someone created their own requests and tricks another user into sending that request

XSS and CSRF attacks commonly happen together, but it's not needed
